    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Read This First</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>This memoir is founded on one idea: <strong>A boy’s childhood lasts until the age of 25.</strong></p>
    <p>After that, it’s time to become a man.</p>
    <p>Every moment from my childhood is detailed below.</p>
    <p>The early chapters are light. The later chapters are heavy.</p>
    <p>It should read like a kid’s book in the kid years, a teen’s book in the teen years, and an adult book in the adult years.</p>
    <p>I won’t use curse words anywhere in this book.</p>
    <p>But I do believe an adult should be present while reading it—because some chapters explore serious topics. I’ll do my best to give you a heads-up before we go down certain roads.</p>
    <p>You’ll also find strong opinions—some you might disagree with. That’s fine. Let’s be adults. Let’s talk it out.</p>
    <p>This book will evolve. I’ll keep updating it as I remember more. One day, it’ll be perfect and no more updates will be required.</p>
    <p>And if you’re hoping to “fact check” some of my statements… well, what is fact anyway?</p>
    <p>Just because some scientist in a lab says 95% of people respond to a drug in a certain way, does that mean it becomes gospel?</p>
    <p>We’re so reliant on science these days, and look where it’s gotten us?!</p>
    <p>Maybe. Maybe not. That’s my take. Disagree with it.</p>
    <p>I hope that by reading this book, you’re inspired to write your own. Your own memoir.</p>
    <p>I’m not special. Well, I am special. But not especially gifted or talented.</p>
    <p>I’m a human… like you. I have gifts. I have talents. And yeah—I probably have what some would call privilege.</p>
    <p>But don’t we all?</p>
    <p>Don’t we all have something that makes us unique, capable, lucky, or loved?</p>
    <p>Whatever that thing is—write it down. Go back. Revise it. Keep updating it until one day… It's perfect. And when it’s perfect—start something new.</p>
    <p>Stop working for someone else. Start working on yourself.</p>
    <p>That’s what inspired this book. I’m done working for someone else. It drove me crazy. Literally.</p>
    <p>I’ve been inside a mental hospital. Twice.</p>
    <p>Who knows? I might be headed back, lol.</p>
    <p>And that’s another thing! Who needs grammar?!</p>
    <p>But seriously—enjoy this book.</p>
    <p>Read the kid sections to your kids at night. That’s what I plan to do.</p>
    <p>How cool would it be if your parents had written down their lives—so it could live on after they were gone?</p>
    <p>Now it’s your turn. Write your story for your kids. For your future self.</p>
    <p>Or maybe… you’ll never be gone. Maybe we’ll solve immortality.</p>
    <p>Either way—</p>
    <p><strong>Enjoy.</strong></p>
    <p>Let me know what you think. Spark a conversation.</p>
    <p><strong>Let’s go.</strong></p>
