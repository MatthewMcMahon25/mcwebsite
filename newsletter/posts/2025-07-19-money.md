# Setting

So you started your own business…

How do you actually make money?

I’m 26 years old, and I’m trying to figure that out too.

I’ve got a website.  
A newsletter.  
A YouTube channel.

I’m showing up consistently on all three — and still, I don’t know how to actually *make* money online.

In the last 7 years of trying, I’ve probably made $50 total:
- A couple of Shopify t-shirt sales  
- A few pennies from TikTok livestreams

That’s it.

But I’ve never been this consistent before.

So what’s the bug?

Why isn’t this clicking?

I’ve been dead broke trying to build something online.  
And I know I’m not alone.

That’s why I’m writing this.  
Not because I have the answers — but because I’m documenting the process of finding them.

If you're feeling stuck — like you're doing all the "right" things and still not making money — you're not alone.

# Antagonist

The Antagonist doesn’t believe it’s possible to make money online.

He says:
- “You have to work for someone else.”
- “Making money on YouTube is for clout-chasers.”
- “Those people just got lucky.”

He sees building something online as foolish.

He thinks the internet is for *watching*, not *creating*.

He’s the opposite of a builder.  
He’s the consummate consumer.

# Protagonist

The Protagonist knows that’s not true.

He believes making money online *is* possible.  
Not because he’s better than anyone — but because he knows no one’s better than him.

He’s seen others do it.  
He believes he can too — if he shows up, builds skills, and serves others, virtually.

He believes that if he stays consistent — posts once or twice a week on YouTube, keeps writing, keeps improving — eventually someone will want to buy what he’s built.

He believes in showing up, even when the numbers are quiet.

The Protagonist works indefinitely, infinitely, in the right direction.  
And because he keeps moving infinitely in that direction, he outpaces those who move faster — because they eventually burn out. He doesn’t.

The Protagonist *has* worked in big companies.  
And he knows that trying too hard makes people feel insecure.  
Work less. Blend in. Don’t make waves — that’s the unspoken rule.

But he’s not built like that.  
So he left.  
Multiple times.

# Conclusion

Here’s what I *do* know about making money online:

It comes down to two things:

1. **Marketing**  
   Marketing is just showing off what you’ve already done.  
   It’s documentation at its finest.

   Write about what you're doing.  
   Talk about what you're building.

   This builds brand awareness, trust, and a reputation.  
   Force yourself to get on camera at least once a week — and be honest.

2. **Product**  
   This one’s still a struggle for me.

   But before the product, comes the skills.  
   I’ve gotten really good at getting in shape.  
   I’m decent at building websites.  
   I’m decent at making films and marketing myself.

   Any one of those could become a product in due time.

---

Some people succeed with a brilliant product and no marketing.  
Others succeed with world-class marketing and a mid product (👋 Prime).

Either way — you need a reason for someone to **pay attention**,  
or a reason for someone to **pay**.  
Or — ideally — both.

That’s the game I’m learning to play.  
I encourage you to join.

In the meantime, I’ll keep sharing what I learn.

Until then — I appreciate you reading.

Peace

Love,
