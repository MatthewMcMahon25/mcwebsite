# Setting
A man in his room working on building a business. He's not finding much traction with writing or filming videos.

He's made a lot of progress on his website.

# Antagonist
He's thinking about giving up. Or, he's thinking about giving 10% of himself to a government job, or a restaurant business. He needs to pay the bills somehow.

# Protagonist
Take your time. Go through your process. Treat your 1-person business like a job. Rome isn't build in a day. It will be built, but not in a day.

# Conclusion
Hereâ€™s your conclusion intro line:

1. Dopamine Detox.
2. Get 8-12 hours of sleep
3. Go to bed earlier.
4. Go through your routine first
5. Have some conversations. Talk to your parents. Say Hello to everyone in your environment.

Love,

Matthew McMahon
