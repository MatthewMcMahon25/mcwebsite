# Setting
My name’s Matthew McMahon. 

# Antagonist
Some call me Matt. 

Others say McMahon. 

Sometimes, it’s Matty Ice. 

Other times it’s Matthew.

# Protagonist
For the purpose of this medium, let’s start with Matthew McMahon.

Feel free to call me any of the above or something else entirely. 

Just be cool with it.

# Conclusion
My plan with this business is to be myself.

Basically anything is fair game.

So much of the advice in the early days of online media was about “choosing a niche” or “finding the customer avatar”.

The real niche is within. 

The individual is the customer avatar.

This sounds corny but be yourself.

Serve yourself.

Create a product for yourself.

Be the audience for yourself.

Once a creator becomes a full-time producer, instead of full-time consumer, they never work another day in their life.

It’s called being self-sufficient.

Self-sustaining.

It’s all about Being.

Love,

Matthew McMahon
