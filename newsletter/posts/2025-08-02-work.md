# Setting

Ever feel like you’re putting in work every day, but nothing seems to be getting accomplished?

You show up to your keyboard. Coffee in hand.  
You type a couple hundred (or thousand) words.

But no one seems to be reading.

You scour the internet for ways to get better.  
You watch YouTube videos.  
You read blog posts and swipe files.  
You study headlines and hooks.  
You obsess over click-through rates and conversion copywriting.

Your goal is simple: make money online.

But the work isn’t translating to dollars.  
And it’s driving you insane.

# Antagonist

Here’s why: your focus is on the wrong thing.

You're obsessed with the outcome.

- The money  
- The likes  
- The followers  
- The subscribers  
- The comments  
- The validation

Every time you hit publish, you’re hoping this is *the one*—the one that finally gets traction.

And when it doesn’t?

You spiral.

# Protagonist

The shift happens when you let go of outcomes.

And instead, focus on inputs.

You stop chasing metrics.  
You stop obsessing over whether something "pops."  
You start building real skills.  
You start stacking real assets.

You stay curious.

- You DM people in your niche  
- You study what they post  
- You analyze how they title their newsletters  
- You dissect their YouTube thumbnails  
- You reverse-engineer what’s working—not to copy, but to understand

Let that be your compass.


# Conclusion

So you’ve finally stopped focusing on the wrong things.  
Now what? What are the *right* metrics?

Let me show you the system I use every week:

1. **Open a blank document**

Start the week with a fresh slate.  
Dump your thoughts. Pour your heart out.  
Aim for 1,000 words—raw, unfiltered, unstructured.

2. **Feed it to ChatGPT**

Let it help you make sense of what you wrote.  
Let it offer clarity and direction.  
Take what’s useful. Discard what isn’t. Keep moving.

3. **Write a rough draft**

Make it *really* rough.  
Use it to think through the problem you’re facing.  
If you can solve it for yourself, you can solve it for someone else.

4. **Feed that to ChatGPT**

Let it reshape your thoughts into something tighter.  
Again, use your judgment. You’re the filter.

5. **Touch up the final draft**

Tweak what needs tweaking. Add your voice back in.  
It doesn’t need to be perfect—it just needs to be *true.*

6. **Publish**

This is your proof of work.  
Publishing is the evidence you’re doing what you said you would.

Keep working.  
Keep building.  
Keep improving your skills.

You got this brother.

Love,
