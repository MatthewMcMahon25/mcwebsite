# Setting
It’s 2025.

It feels like everyone online has their own business.

And in some way, shape, or form, it seems like they’re all trying to sell you something big.

Maybe they’re promoting themselves on social media.

Every week, they’ve got:

- Newsletters landing directly in your inbox
- YouTube videos pinned to the top of your feed
- Tweets on X (are they still called tweets?)
- Reels and photo dumps on Instagram
- LinkedIn posts for the career crowd

How is that possible?

What kind of media engine are they running?

Is it all just AI behind the scenes?

It’s almost like a single person is running an entire digital media company—from their bedroom.

And you're wondering:
How am I supposed to do that?

Remember Luke Skywalker at the beginning of A New Hope?

He’s stuck on Tatooine.
This force-capable, potential warrior... has no purpose.

He’s alone.

Waiting.

Watching.

That might be you right now.

Everyone around you says college is the best path to learn a new skill.

Maybe it’s the family business calling.
Or a “good” job offer with a solid 401(k).

But something else is whispering.

A different opportunity.

A new frontier.

And you’re left asking the same question Luke once did:

**How am I supposed to go after it?**

# Antagonist

The traditional path works.
It really does.

It gave us doctors, lawyers, government workers, priests.
Some of the smartest, most respected people I know are on that path. My dad worked for the government—he was successful.
My friends’ dads are surgeons, attorneys, partners at firms. They did it right.

And now, there’s a new “successful” path:
The finance bro.

Join a big firm.
Work 60-hour weeks.
Climb the ladder.
Build skills.
Contribute to your 401(k).
Get the promotion. Buy the place. Stick it out for 30 years.

That path does work.

But if you’re like me, something about it feels... off.

Like you're playing a game where the rules were written before you were even born.
And no one’s forcing you to play, but somehow, you feel like you have no other choice.

That’s the real antagonist:
The invisible script that says, “This is how life is supposed to go.”

You wake up, go to work, drink on the weekends, and pretend it's fine.
Not because you’re lazy. Not because you hate hard work.
But because none of it lights you up.

We tell ourselves this is freedom—but it doesn’t feel free.

If it were, you'd come in and leave when you want.
You wouldn't feel stuck.
You wouldn’t numb yourself with drinks on Thursday, Friday, Saturday—
only to wake up Sunday, slightly panicked, trying to recover before Monday resets the cycle.

You start to realize you're fueling someone else’s vision while your own quietly fades in the background.

That’s not on them. That’s on you.

Life’s just reflecting back your choices.
And when you start to see it, like really see it—
it’s hard to keep pretending you’re okay with it.

# Protagonist
The protagonist doesn’t subscribe to the default existence.

They feel the pressure to follow the plan—but they don’t give in.
They question it.
They choose something true to themselves (This might be doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc.).

They work—hard.
Monday through Saturday, they give it everything they’ve got.

No shortcuts.

No excuses. 

No victim mindset.

They rest and recover on Sunday—
Not because they’re lazy, but because they understand rhythm:

Stress. Rest. Stress. Rest. That’s how strength is built.

This person doesn’t care about a job title.
They care about themselves.

Their schedule might not make sense to everyone else.
But it’s built with intention. 

Every block of time is a brick in the foundation of a future they believe in. (Shoutout Will Smith for that!)

They don’t drink to forget the week.
They reflect, reset, and plan how to make the next one even better.

They aren’t afraid of work.

They aren't afraid at all, really.

That’s what makes them dangerous.

And that’s why they always win.

Even when they lose.

# Conclusion
So... where do you start?

1. Write a newsletter.

You don’t need a list. You don’t even need an audience.
Just open a doc and write like someone’s reading.
Use this structure:

- Set the scene (Setting)
- Name the villain (Antagonist)
- Introduce the hero (that’s you) (Protagonist)
- End with action (Conclution)

It builds clarity. It builds consistency. And over time—it builds identity.

2. Start a YouTube channel.

You don’t need to edit. You don’t need a crazy setup.
Frame the shot. Hit record. Speak your truth.
Consistency beats aesthetics right now. You’ll get better.

3. Dopamine detox.

Cut out the garbage. TikTok, endless scrolling, gaming loops, short-term highs.
You’re trying to build something long-term—your brain needs bandwidth.

4. Sleep 8–12 hours.

This isn’t hustle culture. This is recovery culture.
You’re not lazy—you’re recharging. You can’t out-discipline exhaustion.

5. Go to bed earlier.

Most of your failures happen the night before.
You don’t need another hour of Netflix.
You need to wake up and be proud of your morning.

Follow your routine first.

Before checking your phone. Before checking someone else’s life.
Own your blocks. That’s where real momentum is built.

6. Talk to people.

People offer so much inspiration if you say the right thiings and ask the right quesitons. Say hi to your parents. Talk to your friends.
Compliment strangers. Being more social in the real world reminds you you’re human.

7. Eat good food.

Your gut is your second brain.
If you’re eating like trash, your thoughts will follow.

8. Drink a ton of water.

Water is the lifeblood.
Every time you feel tired, unmotivated, or foggy—it’s probably dehydration.
Drink more than you think you need.

So...

"When do we start?"
