# Setting
It feels like everyone online has their own business.

And in some way, shape, or form, it seems like they’re all trying to sell you something big.

Maybe they’re promoting themselves on social media.

Every week, they’ve got:

- Newsletter's landing directly in their inbox
- YouTube videos pinned to the top of the feed
- Tweets on X (are they still called tweets?)
- Reels and photo dumps on Instagram
- LinkedIn posts for the career crowd

How is that possible?

What kind of media engine is being run?

Is it all just AI behind the scenes?

It’s almost like a single person is running an entire digital media company—from their home office.

And you're wondering:
How am I supposed to do that?

Remember Luke Skywalker at the beginning of A New Hope?

He’s stuck on Tatooine.
This force-capable, potential warrior... with no purpose.

He’s alone.

Waiting.

Watching.

That could be someone right now.

Everyone around says college is the best path to learn a new skill.

Maybe it’s the family business offering a job to learn while getting paid.
Or it's a fair job offer with a solid 401(k).

But something else is whispering.

A different opportunity.

A new frontier.

And it leaves the same statement Luke once said:

**"It’s not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there’s nothing I can do about it right now."**

# Antagonist

The traditional path works.

It does.

It gave us doctors, lawyers, government workers, priests.
Some of the smartest, most respected people are on that path. My dad worked for the government and he's very successful.
My friend's dad is an attorney and he's doing great.

Even now, there’s a new “successful” career path:
Become "The Finance Bro."

Join a big firm.
Work 40-60 hours a week.
Climb the ladder.
Build skills.
Contribute to a 401(k).
Get the promotion. Buy the place. Stick it out for 30 years.

That path does work.

But if to me, something feels... off.

Like a game is being played where the rules were written before birth.
And no one’s forcing participation, but somehow, it feels like there's no other choice.

That’s the real antagonist:
The invisible script that says, “This is how life is supposed to go.”

Wake up, go to work, drink on the weekends, and pretend it's all fine.
Not because its laziness. Not because hate hard work is hated.
But because none of it fuels the flames of purpose.

It sounds like this is what freedom is—but it doesn’t feel free.

If it were, people would come and go as they pleased.
There wouldn't be this feeling of stuck.
People wouldn’t numb themselves with drinks on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday—
only to wake up Monday, slightly panicked, slightly behind and trying to recover before the cycle resets again on Monday morning.

There's a realization that someone else’s vision is being paid, while everything else quietly fades into the background.

That’s not on them. That’s on me.

Life’s just reflects back choices.
And when it is seen, like really seen—
it’s hard to pretend that it's okay.

# Protagonist
The protagonist doesn’t subscribe to this default existence.

They feel the pressure to follow the plan—but never give in.

They question it.

They are intrigued by it.

They choose something true to themselves (This might even be a doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc.).

They work—hard.

Monday through Saturday, they give it everything they’ve got and empty the tank.

No shortcuts.

No excuses. 

No victim mindset.

They rest and recover on Sunday—
Not because they’re lazy, but because they understand rhythm:

Stress. Rest. Stress. Rest. That’s how strength is built.

This person doesn’t care about a job title.
They care about themselves.

Their schedule might not make sense to everyone else.
But it’s built with intention. 

Every block of time is a brick in the foundation of a future they believe in. (Shoutout Will Smith)

They don’t drink to forget the week.

They reflect, reset, and plan how to make the next one even better.

They aren’t afraid of work.

They aren't afraid at all, really.

That’s what makes them dangerous.

And that’s why they always win.

Even when they lose.

# Conclusion
So... where does one start?

1. **Start a newsletter.**

There don’t need to be a list of 10,000 subscribers. There doesn't even need to be an audience.

Start with an audience of one. Think "I'm the first reader of my newsletter".

Open up a doc and write.

Use this structure:

- Set the scene (Setting)
- Name the villain (Antagonist)
- Introduce the hero (Protagonist)
- End with action (Conclusion)

It builds clarity. It builds consistency. 

Over time—it builds identity.

2. **Start a YouTube channel.**

No need to even edit. There doesn't need to be a crazy setup.
Frame the shot. Hit record. Speak the truth.
Consistency beats aesthetics every day of the week.

There will be improvement.

3. **Dopamine detox.**

Cut out the garbage. TikTok, endless scrolling, gaming loops, short-term highs.
Build something long-term—the brain needs bandwidth.

4. **Sleep 8–12 hours.**

This isn’t hustle culture. This is recovery culture.
This isn't being lazy-it's recharging the batteries. 

5. **Go to bed earlier.**

Most failures happen the night before.
There doesn't need to be another hour of Netflix.
Wake up and be grateful for the morning.

Follow routine first.

Before checking any phone. Before checking someone else’s life.
Own the schedule. Own time. That’s where real momentum is built.

6. **Talk to people.**

People offer so much inspiration if the right things are said and the right quesitons are asked. Say hi to your parents. Talk to friends.
Compliment strangers. Being more social in the real world reminds people that they are human.

7. **Eat good food.**

The gut is the second brain.
Eating like trash creates bad thoughts.

8. **Drink a ton of water.**

Water is the lifeblood.
Every time there's tired, unmotivated, or foggy feelings—it’s a good chance of lack of hydration.
Drink more water.

So...

"When do we start?"
